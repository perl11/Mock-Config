NAME
    Mock::Config - temporarily set Config or XSConfig values

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    XSConfig is readonly, so workaround that.

        use Mock::Config d_fork => 0, perl_patchlevel => '';

    The importer works only dynamically, not lexically yet.

        use Mock::Config;
        Mock::Config->import(startperl => '');
        print $Config{startperl}, ' mocked to empty';
        Mock::Config->unimport;

SUBROUTINES
  import
    Set pair of Config values, even for the readonly XSConfig
    implementation, as used in cperl.

    It does not store the mocked overrides lexically, just dynamically.

  unimport
    This is unstacked and not lexical. It undoes all imported Config values
    at once.
